## Key Features

This project focuses on providing a seamless and responsive user experience, particularly with its navigation. It features:

**Responsive Navigation:** The layout adapts smoothly across different devices, ensuring optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile screens.

**Interactive Dropdown Menus:** Intuitive dropdowns for the "Features" and "Company" sections enhance user experience by organizing content cleanly on the desktop view.

**Mobile Menu:** On smaller screens, the navigation transforms into a clean, easy-to-use hamburger menu with an accompanying overlay for better focus and usability.
